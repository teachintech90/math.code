# Teachers

Below are a few suggestions for teachers using these videos and activities.

1. Use with traditional, blended, or hybrid model.  Can watch the video as a class, assign to watch in class, or assign as homework.

1. The activities can be a module in your course, used for enrichment, used once a week, or used as part of a math club.  Choose what best fits into your curriculum and desired outcomes.

1. Scratch has student accounts.  Check with the technology teacher or others in your building/district to see if the students already have Scratch accounts.  If not, Scratch student accounts are worth pursuing.

1. Verify that students are watching the video and creating the code demonstrated in the video.  Ask them to see the code and/or ask them questions about the video.

1. Most activities will have quite a few problems for the students to attempt.  You can assign each student a different one, have them work in pairs.  You can assign one or more problems.  

1. Grading ... choose how you want to assess and grade these activities.  You can do a completion grade or grade using a pre-defined rubric.  You may want to "screen grade" by having the students show you their code then run it and make sure it work problems.  Have a few test numbers with answers for each problem that you use to verify the code is working properly.

1. You can have the students put a comment in their code with their name in it.  Give differentiated assignments.  Create your own additional problems or have the students create additional problems for their classmates to solve.

1. Have fun with the activities and problems.  Encourage students to try.  Encourage the students to ask questions about the problems if not sure.  Work some or part of the problem on the part or paper if need to.  Discuss how and why the math for the activity or problem works.
