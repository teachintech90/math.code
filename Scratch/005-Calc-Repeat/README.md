## Additional activities

The following may be assigned by your teacher or you can choose to work through on your own.

1. Would you rather have one million dollars now or a penny doubled every day for 30 days?  You would start with 1 cent on day 1, then 2 cents on day 2, then 4 cents on day 3.  Generate a list of the number of dollars (i.e. 1 penny is 0.01 dollars) for each of the 30 days.

1. If you start with a penny and doubled it every day, how many days would it take you to reach one million dollars?

1. Ask the person running your program for the number they would like math facts generated for.  Also ask them the maximum number of facts to generate.  Create a list of addition math facts starting at one and ending with the number the specify.  For instance, if they say the number 7 and 12 math facts, you would list 1 + 7 = 8 then 2 + 7 = 9 through 12 + 7 = 19.

1. Duplicate the code created above and modify it by asking if they would like an addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division list of math facts.  If using the number 7 and 10 math facts, the last subtraction problem would be 17 - 7 = 10 and the last division problem would be 70 / 7 = 10

1. You currently have 395 out of 460 points (an 85.8 %).  There are 8 more 20 point assignments for the rest of the grading period.  Assuming you earn all 20 points on each of those assignments show your grade progression on the next 8 assignments. The first item displayed would look like 415 of 480 points for 86.45833333334% 

1. Additional problems as assigned by your teacher or that you would like to try on your own. Ask your teacher's permission for your idea if this is part of a class.
