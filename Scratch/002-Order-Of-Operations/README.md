## Additional activities

Your teacher will assign you some of the items below or you can choose to work through some of them on your own. If not sure how to do the problem or the terms used, first research and try then ask you teacher if needed.

1. Calculate the total purchase price.  Ask for the cost of the items and the tax rate.  Calculate the amount of tax on the items then the total purchase cost.

1. Ask for the base and the height of a triangle then calculate and display the area of the triangle.

1. Ask for the cost of the items you intend to purchase and the discount percentage for this purchase.  Calculate and display the actual cost of the items after the discount is applied.

1. Ask for the length and the width of rectangle then calculate its perimeter.

1. Calculate the number of bundles of shingles needed to cover a roof.  Ask for the length and width of one side of the roof's plane (measured when on the roof) in feet.  They are using shingles where 3 bundles cover 100 sq ft so each bundle covers 33.3 sq ft.  Assume the house is a two sided roof where both sides have the same dimensions.  Provide the number of bundles of shingles needed to cover the roof.  For example, a 50 ft by 25 ft roof would take 37.5 bundles of shingles for one side or 75 to do both sides.  

1. Calculate the final cost of an item with a series of discounts applied.  Ask for the original price of the item, the percentage of the first discount, and the percentage of the second discount.  First calculate the cost of the item after the first discount is applied.  Then use that cost to apply the second percentage of discount.  Display the final cost of the item after the two series discounts are applied.

1. Additional problems as assigned by your teacher or that you would like to try on your own. Ask your teacher's permission for your idea if this is part of a class.
